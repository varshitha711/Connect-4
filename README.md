# Connect-4
Connect Four is a two players game which takes place on a 6*7 rectangular board placed vertically between them. One player has 21 yellow coins and the other 21 red coins. Each player can drop a coin at the top of the board in one of the seven columns; the coin falls down and fills the lower unoccupied square. Of course a player cannot drop a coin in a certain column if it's already full (i.e. it already contains six coins).

Even if there's no rule about who begins first, we assume, as in chess, that the lighter side makes the first move. We also use the chess notation to represent a square on the board. That is, we number rows from 1 to 7 starting from the bottom and the columns from A to G starting from the leftmost.

The object of the game is to connect four coins vertically, horizontally or diagonally. If the board is filled and no one has alligned four coins  then the game is drawn (i.e. after 42 moves if no one wins).
